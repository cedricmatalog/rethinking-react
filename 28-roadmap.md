3. **You see problems before they happen** - Experience guides you
4. **You make others better** - Through reviews, pairing, mentoring
5. **You deliver full features** - From design to deployment
6. **You make good trade-offs** - Balancing quality and speed
7. **You're comfortable saying "I don't know"** - And finding answers
8. **You think about users** - Not just code
9. **You write maintainable code** - Others can work with it
10. **You embrace ambiguity** - Unclear requirements don't block you

## Final Thoughts

### Remember:

**Senior is not a destination** - It's a continuous journey of growth.

**Everyone's path is different** - Compare yourself only to your past self.

**It takes time** - Typically 5-7 years from starting to code. Don't rush.

**Skills compound** - Small daily improvements add up.

**Community matters** - Learn from and teach others.

**Build things** - Applied knowledge is real knowledge.

**Be patient with yourself** - You're building a career, not running a sprint.

### The Most Important Advice

**1. Write code every day** - Even 30 minutes matters.

**2. Read code constantly** - Study open source projects.

**3. Build in public** - Share your learning journey.

**4. Ask better questions** - Question quality shows growth.

**5. Teach others** - Best way to solidify knowledge.

**6. Stay curious** - Never stop learning.

**7. Focus on fundamentals** - Frameworks change, principles don't.

**8. Ship projects** - Finished is better than perfect.

**9. Seek feedback** - Actively request code reviews.
