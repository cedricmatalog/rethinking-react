## Book Structure

Each chapter follows this format:
1. **Concept Introduction** - Why this matters
2. **Theory & Patterns** - Deep dive into the topic
3. **Interactive Exercises** - Test your understanding with collapsible solutions
4. **Real-World Scenarios** - Case studies and refactoring challenges
5. **Chapter Project** - Build something real to apply concepts
6. **Review Checklist** - Self-assessment

### Exercise Format

This book uses **read-only exercises** designed for self-study:

- **Discussion Questions** - Analyze code and think critically
